## <a name="stoicism"></a> Stoicism

#### <a name="epictetus"></a> Epictetus 
- _Enchiridion_, Chapter 20
  "Remember that it is not he who reviles or strikes you who insults you, but your opinion that these things are insulting. So when anyone makes you angry, know that it is your own thought that has angered you."  
  [Source](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0557.tlg002.perseus-eng1:20)

    > When someone triggers your anger, it's important to acknowledge that this reaction originates within your own cognitive and emotional framework. This may highlight areas where your understanding and intellectual shortcomings affect your ability to respond calmly and rationally.

- _Discourses_, Book 2, Chapter 18 
  "Any person capable of angering you becomes your master; he can anger you only when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him."  
  [Source](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0557.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2)

- _Discourses_, 1.1.32  
  "I have to die.  
  If it is now, well then I die now;  
  If later, then now I will take my lunch, since the hour for lunch has arrived – and dying I will tend to later."  
  [Source](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.1.one.html)

    > Lamenting over the inevitability of death serves no purpose and creates nothing but unnecessary distraction. Instead, cultivate your obsession with a sense of gratitude and certainty. Death is a certainty, but so is the opportunity to live fully until that time comes.

#### <a name="epicurus"></a> Epicurus
- _Letter to Menoeceus_, 3  
  "So death, the most terrifying of ills, is nothing to us, since so long as we exist, death is not with us; but when death comes, then we do not exist. It does not concern either the living or the dead, since for the former it is not, and the latter are no more."  
  [Source](https://users.manchester.edu/Facstaff/SSNaragon/Online/texts/316/Epicurus,%20LetterMenoeceus.pdf)

#### <a name="marcus-aurelius"></a> Marcus Aurelius
- _Meditations_, Book 5, Chapter 16  
  "The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts. So, for instance, if you are constantly contemplating the nature of the universe, you will come to embody its attributes. Similarly, if you are preoccupied with the nature of the good, you will become good. In essence, the character of your soul reflects the nature of your thoughts."  
  [Source](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Meditations_of_the_Emperor_Marcus_Antoninus/Book_5)

#### <a name="xenophon"></a> Xenophon
- _Memorabilia_, Book 3, Chapter 12  
  "Besides, it is a disgrace to grow old through sheer carelessness before seeing what manner of man you may become by developing your bodily strength and beauty to their highest limit. But you cannot see that, if you are careless; for it will not come of its own accord."  
  [Source](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg002.perseus-eng1:3.12)

## <a name="existentialism"></a> Existentialism

#### <a name="jean-paul-sartre"></a> Jean-Paul Sartre
- _Being and Nothingness_, 1943, Part 1, Chapter 2  
  "If you are lonely when you're alone, you are in bad company."  
  [Source](https://archive.org/details/beingnothingness0000sart)

    > When one feels lonely even in solitude, it reveals a disconnection from one’s own thoughts and feelings. This suggests that the discomfort isn’t solely about the absence of others, but also about how external distractions may prevent one from finding comfort and meaning within oneself.

- _The Devil and the Good Lord_, 1951, Third Act  
  "See that void above our heads? That's God. Silence is God, absence is God. God is the solitude of men."  
  [Source](https://archive.org/details/devilgoodlord0000sart)

#### <a name="friedrich-nietzsche"></a> Friedrich Nietzsche
- _Beyond Good & Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future_, 1886, Aphorism 146  
  "He who fights with monsters should see to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you."  
  [Source](https://archive.org/details/beyondgoodevilpr1909niet)

#### <a name="viktor-frankl"></a> Viktor E. Frankl
- _Man’s Search for Meaning_, 2, Page 112  
  "When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves."  
  [Source](https://archive.org/details/manssearchformea0000fran)

#### <a name="alexis-carrel"></a> Alexis Carrel
- _Man The Unknown_, 1935, Chapter 8, 1  
  "Man must remake himself. And he cannot remake himself without suffering. For he is both the marble and the sculptor. In order to uncover his true visage he must shatter his own substance with heavy blows of his hammer. He will not submit to such treatment unless driven by necessity. While surrounded by the comfort, the beauty, and the mechanical marvels engendered by technology, he does not understand how urgent is this operation. He fails to realize that he is degenerating." [^1]  
  [Source](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.168284/)

#### <a name="hermann-hesse"></a> Hermann Hesse
- _Der Steppenwolf_, 1927, Page 10  
  "'Most men will not swim before they are able to.' Is that not witty? Naturally, they won't swim! They are born for the solid earth, not for the water. And naturally they wont think. They are made for life, not for thought. Yes, and he who thinks, what’s more, he who makes thought his business, he may go far in it, but he has bartered the solid earth for the water all the same, and one day he will drown."  
  [Source](https://archive.org/details/steppenwolf0000hess)

    > We are grounded beings, thriving on solid earth and direct experience, not on abstract musings. Those who immerse themselves in relentless introspection might achieve great insights, but in doing so, they risk losing touch with the very essence of living that keeps them anchored.

#### <a name="van-der-leeuw"></a> J.J. Van Der Leeuw
- _The Conquest of Illusion_, 1928, 4, Page 9  
  "Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced."  
  [Source](https://archive.org/details/conquestofillusi0000jjva)

## <a name="naturalism"></a> Naturalism

#### <a name="paul-ricoeur"></a> Paul Ricœur
- _Le temps raconté_, Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale, 1983, 4, Page 440  
  "On a cosmic scale, our lifespan is insignificant, and yet this brief period during which we appear on the world’s stage is where all questions of significance stem."  
  [Source](https://archive.org/details/tempsetrcit0000ricu)

#### <a name="alasdair-gray"></a> Alasdair Gray  
- _Poor Things_, 1992, Chapter 14  
  "As God, my father, says, it is only the way it is until we discover the new way it is, and then that is the way it is until we discover the new way it is, and so it goes until the world is no longer flat, electricity lights the night, and shoes are no longer tied with ribbons."  
  [Source](https://archive.org/details/poorthingsepisod00gray)

#### <a name="andre-georges-haudricourt"></a> André-Georges Haudricourt
- _Pratiques de la Culture des Fruits_, 1987, 169  
  "What if the other living creatures were the ones who taught humans? What if the horses taught them how to run? The frogs how to swim? The plants how to wait?"  
  [Source](https://archive.org/details/latechnologiesci0000haud)

## <a name="virtue-ethics"></a> Virtue Ethics

#### <a name="laozi"></a> Laozi (老子)  
- _Tao Te Ching (道德经)_, 400 BC, Chapter 68  
  "One who excels as a warrior does not appear formidable;  
  One who excels in fighting is never roused in anger;  
  One who excels in defeating his enemy does not join issue;  
  One who excels in employing others humbles himself before them." [^2]  
  [Source](http://classics.mit.edu/Lao/taote.html)

    > He who knows himself does not aspire to more than what nature has given him; he does not seek to rise above his condition. He who compares himself eventually fades away in his own misery. The obsession with measuring oneself against others erodes self-esteem, creating a void that neither recognition nor external successes can fill.

#### <a name="miyamoto-musashi"></a> Miyamoto Musashi (宮本 武蔵)

- _The Way of Walking Alone_, 1645, Precept 4  
  "Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world."  
  [Source](https://archive.org/details/fritzkeys-dokkodo-musashi)

    > Reevaluating the scale of existence is truly the leading path to understanding the realm to which we belong. We will invariably remain smaller than a mountain, eternally dominated by the vastness of the planets, and perpetually distant from the farthest star.

- _The Book of Five Rings_, 1645, Book 4  
  "Preoccupied with a single leaf, you won’t see the tree. Preoccupied with a single tree, you’ll miss the entire forest."  
  [Source](https://archive.org/details/bookoffiverings0000miya)

- _The Book of Five Rings_, 1645, Book 5  
  "There's nothing outside you that can make you better, stronger, richer, faster or smarter. It's all inside you. Don't look for anything outside yourself."  
  [Source](https://archive.org/details/bookoffiverings0000miya)

    > Our body and muscles are tools that can be cultivated through discipline and effort, much like sharpening the mind with knowledge and practice. What lies beyond the palms of one’s hands must not pervert one’s self, for the sole dominion we possess is over our own being.

#### <a name="bible"></a> Holy Bible 
- _New International Version_, Matthew, 7:1-2  
  <sup>1</sup> "Do not judge, or you too will be judged.  
  <sup>2</sup> For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."  
  [Source](https://archive.org/details/holybiblenewinte0000unse)

- _New International Version_, Matthew, 7:13-14  
  <sup>13</sup> "Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.  
  <sup>14</sup> But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."  
  [Source](https://archive.org/details/holybiblenewinte0000unse)

- _New International Version_, Romans, 7:15-17  
  <sup>15</sup> "I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.  
  <sup>16</sup> And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.  
  <sup>17</sup> As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me."
